Assignment 1:

The purpose of this Assignment was to compare the effect between two and three hidden layers s on the validation accuracy. The MSE loss function was used instead of binary_crossentropy and Tanh activation was implemented instead of the relu.  The main tasks for this assignment was to choose a technique that will improve the model performance. I used the Dropout technique to improve the model. I use IMDB dataset in Keras package for this assignment.
